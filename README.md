5. ## Introduction
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code. 
This repository aims to provide a collection of well-documented implementations of commonly used data structures 
and algorithms. Each implementation is written in a specific programming language and is accompanied by detailed 
explanations and examples to aid in comprehension.

## Data Structures
The repository currently includes the following data structures:

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Hash Table
6. Binary Tree
7. Binary Search Tree
8. Heap
9. Graph
10. Trie
11. Union-Find
12. AVL Tree
13. Red-Black Tree
14. B-tree
16. Strings

Each data structure is organized into its own directory and contains the implementation file(s), along with a README 
file explaining the structure's characteristics, operations, and use cases.

## Algorithms
The repository also includes implementations of various algorithms, such as:

1. Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
2. Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
3. Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
4. Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence)

Similar to the data structures, the algorithms are organized into their respective directories and include explanation 
files detailing their time and space complexity, as well as example usage.
